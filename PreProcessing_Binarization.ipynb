    "Binarization is a digital image processing technique used to convert a grayscale image or a color image into a binary image. The binary image created as a result of binarization contains only two pixel values, typically 0 and 1, where 0 represents the background (usually black) and 1 represents the foreground or the object of interest (usually white). Binarization is a fundamental preprocessing step in various computer vision and image analysis applications, particularly in the areas of document analysis, optical character recognition (OCR), and pattern recognition."

It is particularly useful in applications where the structure or shape of objects is more important than their color or intensity. Despite its simplicity, binarization requires careful consideration of threshold selection and is influenced by factors such as lighting and background complexity. When applied correctly, binarization can significantly enhance the performance of image analysis systems."
